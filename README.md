Early accident prediction using dashcam videos plays a crucial role in enhancing the safety of modern intelligent transportation systems. However, despite existing research efforts to capture more visual information by employing different feature extraction methods within the same frame, there remains a lack of consistency representation among different features. To address this issue, we introduce contrastive learning into the field of accident prediction and propose a novel feature fusion module for deep integration of diverse features. We treat features from the same frame as positive pairs and those from different frames as negative pairs, thereby amplifying the similarity of positive pairs while increasing the dissimilarity of negative pairs. This approach enhances the model's ability to capture the consistency of data within the same frame. Additionally, we redefine the accident prediction task by converting it into an anomaly score regression problem using soft labels. We extensively evaluate our method on two public datasets and conduct comprehensive experiments to assess its performance. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art accident prediction approaches.
